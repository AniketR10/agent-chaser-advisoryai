RECOMMENDATIONS STATUS
Last Full Review: Jan 2026
IN PROGRESS:
* Grief counselling and emotional support
   * Cruse Bereavement support completed
   * Monthly peer support group ongoing and beneficial
PENDING:
* Margaret’s ISA (£47k) consolidation
   * Eligible for spousal ISA transfer
   * Still in Margaret’s name due to emotional barrier
   * Adviser to prepare paperwork; Brian only needs to sign
* Financial simplification
   * Currently: 8 savings accounts, 2 ISAs, 1 investment platform
   * Plan: reduce to 2–3 providers total
   * Adviser to prepare step-by-step consolidation plan
IN PROGRESS:
* Downsizing exploration
   * Target: 2-bed bungalow ~£450k
   * Current home £625k → net release ~£150k after ~£25k costs
   * Emotional attachment significant after 34 years
   * Timeline flexible (“when it feels right”)
PENDING:
* £30k support for Sarah
Options considered:
A) Gift £30k now (PET; affordable; fairness discussion with Andrew)
B) Loan £30k (formal agreement; repayment risk; family strain)
C) Advance on inheritance (documented reduction of Sarah’s £300k share)
Recommendation remains: Option A, with transparency to Andrew
✓ Will updated March 2023 (post-Margaret)
✓ LPAs completed May 2023 (Property & Financial; Health & Welfare)
DECLINED:
   * Equity release (Brian dislikes debt; prefers downsizing or retaining home)
CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES
   1. Sarah financial support
   * £30k gift manageable from cash reserves
   * Recommend discussion with Andrew to preserve fairness
   2. Downsizing benefits
   * Reduced maintenance and running costs (~£1,800/year saving)
   * No stairs; safer long-term
   * Unlocks ~£150k equity for flexibility or gifting
   3. Excess cash deployment
   * Cash & Premium Bonds total £145k
   * Retain £30k emergency fund
   * Gradually invest £115k excess
   * Suggested allocation: max 30% equities / 70% bonds
   * Aim: protect purchasing power while respecting low risk tolerance
   4. State benefits check
   * Pension Credit unlikely but worth confirming
   * Council Tax Reduction, free prescriptions, eye tests, bus pass applicable
   5. Travel planning
   * Australia trip ~£6k (BAE colleagues)
   * Europe travel with sister ~£10k/year affordable from surplus
CONCERNS & RISKS
   * Loneliness and long-term mental health risk
   * House size and maintenance burden with declining mobility
   * Financial complexity overwhelming without Margaret
   * Potential family tension if Sarah helped without Andrew’s knowledge
   * Long-term health and possible care costs (£50k/year typical)
   * Very conservative asset allocation exposed to inflation erosion
   * Emotional aversion to investment risk following bereavement
UPCOMING ACTIONS

   * Always offers tea/biscuits – accept (rapport-building)
   * Keep meetings to 60–75 minutes to avoid fatigue
   * Very proud of long BAE career (38 years)
