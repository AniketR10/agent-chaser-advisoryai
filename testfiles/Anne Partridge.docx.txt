RECENT CHANGES (Jan 2026 Review)
* Alan’s contract renewal (April 2024) continues to provide short-term security
* Salary remains static at £68k
* Station ratings still under pressure from younger competitors
* Lynne’s back problems persist; work increasingly uncomfortable
* Portugal villa research ongoing; viewing trip completed in 2025 but no commitment made
* Lexus upgrade remains a firm aspiration for 2026
TAX POSITION
* Alan: £68k income (higher-rate taxpayer on portion)
* Lynne: £24k income (basic rate)
* No significant tax planning currently in place
* Lynne’s personal allowance partially unused
RECOMMENDATIONS STATUS
Last Full Review: Jan 2026
PENDING:
* Alan pension contributions increase
   * Currently no voluntary contributions
   * Salary sacrifice £8k–£10k/year would materially reduce retirement shortfall
   * Without action: projected income c. £43k vs £55k target (shortfall £12k/year)
   * Recommendation remains: minimum £8k/year salary sacrifice
DECLINED (FOR NOW):
* Mediterranean villa purchase
   * Concerns remain: currency risk, rental uncertainty, property concentration
   * Lynne prefers renting first; Alan strongly lifestyle-driven
   * Decision: revisit after further reflection; if proceeding, cap £150k
IN PROGRESS:
* Lexus upgrade planning (2026)
   * Budget £45k cash
   * Options narrowed to new vs 1-year approved used
   * Recommendation remains nearly-new (£40k) to limit depreciation
PENDING:
* Lynne early retirement decision (2027)
   * Full retirement at 60 reduces surplus materially
   * Recommendation remains phased reduction (3 days/week) rather than full stop
NOT STARTED:
* Wills review
   * Existing wills dated 2008
   * No children; executors ageing; LPAs absent
   * Deferred pending clarity on villa / Lexus decisions
OPPORTUNITIES
1. Income splitting
   * Shift savings/investments to Lynne’s name
   * Potential tax saving ~£1.5k/year
2. Pension efficiency
   * £8k/year salary sacrifice for Alan = strong net benefit
3. Villa alternative strategy
   * Invest £180k portfolio (~£9k income) and rent villa as required
4. Lexus timing
   * Delay to 2027 reduces depreciation and smooths cashflow
5. Lynne reduced hours sooner
   * Move to 3 days/week from late 2026 improves health and quality of life
CONCERNS & RISKS
* Alan job security in declining radio industry
* Retirement income shortfall if pension contributions not increased
* High property concentration risk if overseas villa purchased
* Lifestyle inflation (£45k car + £180k villa in short period)
* Lynne’s health may force earlier retirement than planned
* Alan’s resistance to advice driven by ego and identity concerns
UPCOMING ACTIONS
Before Next Review (2026):
* Alan to decide on pension contribution increase
* Further analysis of villa costs and ownership implications
* Lexus test drives completed
* Lynne GP / physio follow-up for back problems
At Next Review (2027):
* Retirement income gap revisited with updated projections
* Final decision on Mediterranean property
* Lexus purchase confirmed or deferred
* Lynne retirement or hours-reduction plan agreed
* Wills and LPAs scheduled
RECENT COMMUNICATION
15/01/26: Alan email expressing confidence after contract renewal
18/01/26: Lynne call – back problems worsening

NOTES
* Alan confident and defensive; ego closely tied to career and status
* Lynne pragmatic and quietly concerned; key ally in planning
* No-children topic avoided
* Alan responds best to firm data presented authoritatively
* Risk of expensive lifestyle decisions masking retirement insecurity
* Important to manage Alan’s self-image while protecting long-term outcomes
