RECOMMENDATIONS STATUS
Last Full Review: Jan 2026
1. ✓ DONE: Increased pension 8%→12% (£11,040/year), saves £4,968 tax (45% relief)
2. PENDING: Consolidate AZ pension (£68k) – deferred due to relationship/property uncertainty
REVISIT: 2026/27 tax year
3. DECLINED: Reduce mortgage term 15→12 years (£200/month extra) – flexibility preferred
4. ✓ DONE: Will updated (Dec 2024) – Estate: 50% mother, 30% sister, 20% nieces
NOTE: Update required if cohabiting/marriage proceeds
5. PENDING: LPAs – forms completed but not yet registered
ACTION: Submit to OPG in 2026
6. PENDING: Pre-nup discussion if marrying Tom – combined assets c. £1.1m
Emma remains resistant (“unromantic”) – handle sensitively
7. ✓ DONE: ISA contributions maximised at £20k/year
CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES
   1. Salary increase embedded: Extra £7k/year already redirected to ISA ✓
   2. Commission improved: Expected £35k+
Recommend: £10k bonus sacrifice to pension – saves £4,500 tax
   3. Relationship/property decision – THREE SCENARIOS:
A) Marry & buy together: Sell both (£1,015k equity), buy £1.1m, mortgage £365k
Joint £2,100/month (Emma £1,050) – SAVES £300/month
B) Move into Tom’s: Rent Emma’s £2,200/month – mortgage £1,350 = £850 surplus
Share Tom’s costs +£800 → Net +£50/month
C) Tom moves into Emma’s: Tom rents his (£2,400/month), pays half Emma’s £675
Emma SAVES £675/month
RECOMMEND: B or C short-term; marry/buy in 1–2 years
   4. Mother’s care planning:
Mother assets £180k; care £5k/month (£60k/year) ≈ 3 years cover
After: Emma may contribute £2k/month
Recommend: LTC insurance £150/month or plan £2k/month from age 75
   5. Sabbatical age 50 (4 years): Need £60k
Recommend: £800/month separate pot = £57,600 + interest ≈ £63k ✓
CONCERNS & RISKS
      * Single income reliance (mitigated by IP, savings, no dependants)
      * Relationship entanglement without cohabitation agreement – legal grey area
      * Mother’s care costs: £30k/year × 10 years = £300k potential impact
      * Property timing risk if buying jointly – preferable to wait 12–18 months
      * Career burnout risk – sabbatical likely necessary, not optional
UPCOMING ACTIONS
Before Next Review (2026/27):
      * LPA registration completion
      * Formal relationship/property decision with Tom
      * Pension consolidation revisit
      * Mother care funding strategy agreed
At Next Review (2027):
      * Updated retirement projections
      * Property/relationship scenario modelling
